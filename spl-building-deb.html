<p>The spl uses an autoconf style build system which is designed to
allow it to build against multiple versions of the Linux kernel.  Simply build
it as you would any other autoconf style project.  The build system will make
an educated guess as to which kernel you wish to build against.  If it guesses
wrong simply specify your kernel devel headers using the <em>--with-linux</em>
configure option.  You may also need the <em>--with-linux-obj</em>
configure option if the kernel build objects are installed in a different
directory.

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential gawk alien fakeroot linux-headers-$(uname -r)
$ ./configure
$ make deb
</pre>

<p>The result of this will be two source rpm packages...  Yes, source rpm
packages.  Currently, deb style packages are built by first creating rpm
packages and then converting them to deb packages using alien.  Long term
we would like to directly create deb packages but it has not been a priority.
If anyone familiar with Debian style packaging would like to help with this
please feel free to contact us.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>spl-w.x.y-z.src.rpm</em>: Source for the spl utilities.</li>
	<li><em>spl-modules-w.x.y-z.src.rpm</em>: Source for the kernel
	modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>And three binary deb packages for your platform.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>spl-w.x.y-z_arch.deb</em>: The spl utilities.</li>
	<li><em>spl-modules-w.x.y-z_kernel_arch.deb</em>:
	The spl module for your kernel version.</li>
	<li><em>spl-modules-devel-w.x.y-z_kernel_arch.deb</em>:
	The spl development headers and symbols for building dependent
	kernel modules.
</ul>

<p>Next go ahead and install the packages,</p>

<pre>
$ sudo dpkg -i *_amd64.deb

Selecting previously deselected package spl.
(Reading database ... 225178 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking spl (from spl_0.5.1-2_x86_64.deb) ...
Selecting previously deselected package spl-modules.
Unpacking spl-modules (from spl-modules_0.5.1-2_x86_64.deb) ...
Selecting previously deselected package spl-modules-devel.
Unpacking spl-modules-devel (from spl-modules-devel_0.5.1-2_x86_64.deb) ...
Setting up spl (0.5.1-2) ...
Setting up spl-modules (0.5.1-2) ...
Setting up spl-modules-devel (0.5.1-2) ...
</pre>

<p>At this point you&#8217;re all set.  You can now move on to the next step
and <a href="zfs-building-deb.html">build the zfs packages</a>.  If you would
like to verify the packages you just built you can run the included
<a href="spl-regression-suite.html">regression test suite</a>.
