<p><b>A development version of the ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) is
now available!</b></p>

<p>This is the functionality you need to be able to mount ZFS
like a normal Linux filesystem.  All the core functionality is
in place but several of the advanced features still need to be
implemented.  My hope is that by making this code available before
it is 100% feature complete the Linux ZFS community can contribute
to finishing the missing features.  You can download the development
source with ZPL support here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/spl/tarball/master">master</a>
  - SPL Master Branch<br></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/tarball/zpl">zpl</a>
  - ZPL Development Branch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Before downloading the source you should be aware of two things.</p>
<ol>
  <li> This branch currently <i>only</i> supports 2.6.32-2.6.36 based
Linux kernels.  Support for newer kernels is a high priority item on
the official list of <a href="zfs-development-items.html">
zfs development items</a>.</li>
  <li> This is a development and not production branch.  That means
there still are rough edges which could for example crash your system.
I've intentionally released this code as soon as it was reasonable to
do so, because my hope is that the community can help stabilize the
branch.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your not a developer and you absolutely need to have ZFS on
Linux today.  There is an alternate implementation of the ZPL which
was produced by <a href="http://kqinfotech.com/"> KQ Infotech</a>.
You can download their implementation from
<a href=http://kqstor.com>kqstor.com</a>.  Their port is based
of the spl/zfs-0.5.2 version so it does include features such
as deduplication.  We are in the process of reviewing, refining,
and integrating their proposed changes in to afore mentioned
development branch.</p>

<p>We would also love to see a FUSE based implementation.
Currently all the zfs code in this project builds cleanly in the
kernel as a module and in user space as a dynamic library used by
ztest.  Getting this code base working with zfs-fuse should mainly
be a matter of adding the needed FUSE bits which the
<a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/">ZFS-FUSE folks</a> clearly showed
us can be done!  It would be very nice from a development standpoint
if these two projects could share a common code base.</p>
