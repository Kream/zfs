<p>Sorry, the ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) which allows you to mount the
filesystem is still a work in progress.  There is a working beta
available <a href="http://zfs.kqinfotech.com/">here</a> which is
being produced by <a href="http://www.kqinfotech.com/">KQInfotech</a>.
This port is currently based on the older spl/zfs-0.4.7 tags which
means it does not yet support features such as de-duplication.
We do plan to intergrate it in to the latest spl/zfs code base
over the coming months.</p>

<p>We would also love to see a FUSE based implementation.
Currently all the zfs code in this project builds cleanly in the
kernel as a module and in user space as a dynamic library used by
ztest.  Getting this code base working with zfs-fuse should mainly
be a matter of adding the needed FUSE bits which the
<a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/">ZFS-FUSE folks</a> clearly showed
us can be done!  It would be very nice from a development standpoint
if these two projects could share a common code base.  If any
zfs-fuse developers are interested in persuring this with us please
drop us an <a href="mailto:behlendorf1@llnl.gov">email</a>.</p>
