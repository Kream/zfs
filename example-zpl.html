<p>Sorry, the ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) which allows you to mount the
file system is still a
<a href=http://groups.google.com/a/zfsonlinux.org/group/zfs-discuss/browse_thread/thread/96c8b21d9d416907#">
work in progress</a>.  This code is being actively
developed and our expectation is to start merging these changes in
to master branch in early 2011.  As always we would love help from
the community.  If you'd like to help please drop me an
<a href="mailto:behlendorf1@llnl.gov">email</a>.</p>

</p>If you absolutely need to have ZFS on Linux today an implementation
of the ZPL was produced by <a href="http://kqinfotech.com/">
KQ Infotech</a>.  You can download their implementation from
<a href=http://kqstor.com>kqstor.com</a>.  Their port is based
of the spl/zfs-0.5.2 version so it does include features such
as deduplication.  We are in the process of reviewing, refining,
and integrating their proposed changes.</p>

<p>We would also love to see a FUSE based implementation.
Currently all the zfs code in this project builds cleanly in the
kernel as a module and in user space as a dynamic library used by
ztest.  Getting this code base working with zfs-fuse should mainly
be a matter of adding the needed FUSE bits which the
<a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/">ZFS-FUSE folks</a> clearly showed
us can be done!  It would be very nice from a development standpoint
if these two projects could share a common code base.</p>
