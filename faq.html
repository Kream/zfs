<a name="WhatAboutTheLicensingIssue">
<h3>1.1 What about the licensing issue?</h3></a>

<p>In a nutshell, the issue is that the Linux kernel which is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CDDL">incompatible</a>
with ZFS which is licensed under the Sun <a
href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/opensolaris_license">CDDL</a>.
While both the GPL and CDDL are open source licenses their terms are such that
it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both licenses.  This means that a
single <em>derived work</em> of the Linux kernel and ZFS cannot be legally
<em>distributed</em>.</p>

<p>One way to resolve this issue is to implement
<a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/">ZFS in user space with FUSE</a> where it is not
considered a <em>derived work</em> of the kernel.  This approach resolves the
licensing issues but it has some technical drawbacks.  There is another option
though.  The CDDL does not restrict modification and release of the ZFS source
code which is <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/on/downloads/current/">publicly
available</a> as part of OpenSolaris.  The ZFS code can be modified to build
as a CDDL licensed kernel module which is <em>not distributed</em> as part of
the Linux kernel.  This makes a Native ZFS on Linux implementation possible if
you are willing to
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/downloads">download</a> and
<a href="zfs-building-rpm.html">build it</a> yourself.</p>

<a name="WhyDoesntItBuild">
<h3>1.2 Why doesn&#8217;t it build?</h3></a>

<p>Building a kernel module against an arbitrary kernel version is a
complicated thing to do.  Every distro has their own idea of how this should
be done.  It depends on the base kernel version, any distro specific patches,
and exactly how the kernel was configured and built.  If you run in to
problems here are few thing to check.  If none of these things explain your
problem please open up a new
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/spl/issues">SPL issue</a> or a new
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues">ZFS issue</a> as
appropriate.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The kernel API changes frequently and kernels newer than
2.6.36 are not yet supported.</li>
	<li>Check for known <a
href="http://github.com/behlendorf/spl/issues/labels/Build%20Issue">SPL</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues/labels/Build%20Issue">ZFS</a>
build issues.</li>
	<li>There is also a list of
<a href="platforms-0.6.0-rc1.html">tested platforms</a> you might find helpful.</li>
	<li>Make sure CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled in your kernel
(<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues/#issue/83">issue 83</a>).</li>
</ul>

<a name="HowDoIMountTheFileSystem">
<h3>1.3 How do I mount the file system?</h3></a>

<p>The <a href="example-zpl.html">ZFS posix layer</a> is now available as of
spl/zfs-0.6.0-rc1!  A mountable dataset will be created and mounted when you
first create the pool with <i>zpool create</i>.  Additional datasets can be
created with <i>zfs create</i> and they will be automatically mounted.</p>

<a name="WhyShouldIUseA64BitSystem">
<h3>1.4 Why should I use a 64-bit system?</h3></a>

<p>In the Solaris kernel it is common practice to make heavy use of the
virtual address space because it is designed to work well. However, in
the Linux kernel most memory is addressed with a physical address and use of
the virtual address space is strongly discouraged. This is particularly true
on 32-bit arches where the virtual address space is limited to roughly 100MiB
by default. Using the virtual address space on 64-bit Linux kernels is also
discouraged.  But in this case the address space is so much larger than
physical memory it is not as much of an issue.</p>

<p>If you are bumping up against the virtual memory limit you will see
this message in your system logs.  You can increase the virtual address size
with the boot option <em>vmalloc=512M</em>.</p>

<pre>
vmap allocation for size 4198400 failed: use vmalloc=&lt;size&gt; to increase
size.

<a name="HowCanIHelp">
<h3>1.5 How can I help?</h3></a>

<p>The most helpful thing you can do is to try ZFS on your Linux
system and report any
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues">issues</a>.  If you 
like what you see and would like to contribute to the project please send
<a href="http://github.com/behlendorf">me</a> an email.  There are quite a few
open issues on the <a href="http://github.com/behlendorf/zfs/issues">issue
tracker</a> which need attention or if you have an idea of your own that is
fine too.</p>
